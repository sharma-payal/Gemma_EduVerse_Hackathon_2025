        "content": "That's a really tricky question! The color of the sky isn't actually a single, simple color. It's a complex phenomenon caused by a process called **scattering**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n* **Blue during the day:** Most of the time, the sky appears blue. This is because of a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Sunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow. When it enters the Earth's atmosphere, it bumps into tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen). Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered more strongly than other colors.  Think of it like bouncing a blue bouncy ball off of many tiny obstacles - it bounces around in all directions, making the sky look blue.\n\n* **Red at sunrise and sunset:** When the sun is low on the horizon, the sunlight has to travel through *much* more of the atmosphere to reach your eyes. This means that most of the blue light has been scattered away before it gets to you.  What\u2019s left are the longer wavelengths, like red and orange.\n\n* **Other colors:** Sometimes you might see pink, purple, or yellow in the sky, especially during sunrise and sunset, due to a combination of scattering and absorption of different wavelengths of light.\n\n**So, to answer your question directly:** The sky is *primarily* blue during the day, but it can change to red, orange, pink, and purple depending on the time of day and atmospheric conditions.\n\n\nDo you want me to dive deeper into any particular aspect of this, like Rayleigh scattering, atmospheric conditions, or different times of day?"
